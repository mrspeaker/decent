* Decent

A not very decent go at Descent.

    {
        var rot = ship.rotation;
        rot.z = -rot.z;
        navball.localRotation = Quaternion.Slerp(navball.localRotation, rot, _slerpSpeed);
    }


--------


Quaternion relRot = Program.VesselInfo.WorldToReference(Program.VesselInfo.VesselOrientation, VesselInformation.FrameOfReference.Navball);
Vector3 forward = relRot * Vector3.up;
double roll = forward.SignedAngle((Vector3.up - forward)*-1, relRot * Vector3.forward);

//the signed angle method:

        public static float SignedAngle(this Vector3 normal, Vector3 a, Vector3 
        {
            return Mathf.Atan2(
                Vector3.Dot(normal, Vector3.Cross(a, ),
                Vector3.Dot(a, ) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
        }

I create a vector going from UP (0,1,0) to the up vector of the vessel (which is basically the forward vector, it's the point on the navball). The I simply calculate the angle between that and the actual forward vector of the vessel along the up axis of the vessel.
